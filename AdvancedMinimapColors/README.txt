This is a template I've created mostly to help myself create new Puck Mod projects

IMPORTANT: you will need to add a libs folder with all the .dll available
at the time of making this template the .dll are located in your Puck\Puck_Data\Managed folder

CodeSamples.cs has some pieces of code as reference that I think are quite useful or consistently needed
you'll also find in similar pieces in Plugin and ModSettings

ModSettings is used for creating a configuration file (.json)
so naturally is not needed if you don't desire configuration
